# Mind-s-Eye
Mind's Eye is a project that converts EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals into visual representations using machine learning models, specifically Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The system translates brain activity into images in real-time, offering applications in neurofeedback, brain-computer interfaces (BCI), and cognitive research.
